/**
 * Simple functional logging utility.
 *
 * Here are the steps you need to follow to enable logging:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>In your code, somewhere in scope (using "implicits" scope rules), import Flog._</li>
 * <li>Create a String which will form the log message, follow it with "!!" and follow that with the expression you want to log.</li>
 * <li>Most of the time, this is all you need to do.</li>
 * <li>If you wish to override the logging function, then declare something like the following:
 * <code>implicit def logFunc(w: String): LogFunction = LogFunction(p-r-i-n-t-l-n)</code> (take out the dashes, obviously).
 * In this case, you will need to explicitly construct an instance of Flogger from your message string, such as:
 * <code>Flogger(getString)(logFunc)</code>
 * Follow this with !! and the expression, as usual.
 * </li>
 * <li>If you wish to override the default LogFunction, for example to log according to a particular class,
 * then you can also set it (it is declared as a var):
 * <code>Flog.loggingFunction = Flog.getLogger[FlogSpec]</code>
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * There are several ways to turn logging off (temporarily or permanently) once you've added the log expressions:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>(1A)</dt> <dd>replace the !! method with the |! method for each expression you wish to silence;</dd>
 * <dt>(1B)</dt> <dd>define an implicit LogFunction which does nothing (but this will involve explicitly constructing a Flogger, as described above);</dd>
 * <dt>(2)</dt> <dd>set Flog.enabled = false in your code (silences all logging everywhere);</dd>
 * <dt>(3)</dt> <dd>remove the !! expressions.</dd>
